## Code Samples

Below are details of the examples of my code and structure included in this repository. I hope these give you a good idea as to how I code and keep things organized.

### Date Formatter

This is a tool I built to allow me to take the default date rendered by Drupal and convert it to the
format requested by the designed. As there are multiple displays that use these dates, I had to include 
support for not only events, but also news articles and, in one case, the Twitter feed.

### String Splitter

Often, the designer requests that a string, such a block title, be styled in multiple ways, such as 
two different colors or italicizing the last word. I created this simple script to split that string 
into usable spans to allow me to do so.

### Style & Structure

This is an example of my typical directory structure, code style, and code standards.
