### Websites

I was responsible for implementing our base theme and all custom styling and functionality of the following websites. Those with an asterisk are not yet live and may have some goofs as the clients are working on content.

### Sample Code

Below, I detail the examples of my code and structure included in this repository. I hope these give you a good idea as to how I code and keep things organized.

#### Date Formatter

> This is a tool I built to allow me to take the default date rendered by Drupal and convert it to the format requested by the designer. As there are multiple displays that use these dates, I had to include support for not only events, but also news articles and, in one case, the Twitter feed. ***[Sample](https://github.com/sixty7ss/code-samples/tree/master/Date%20Formatter)***

#### String Splitter

> Often, the designer requests that a string, such a block title, be styled in multiple ways, such as two different colors or italicizing the last word. I created this simple script to split that string into usable spans to allow me to do so. ***[Sample](https://github.com/sixty7ss/code-samples/tree/master/String%20Splitter)***

#### Style & Structure

> This is an example of my typical directory structure, code style, and code standards. Files that begin with an underscore were not written by me, but are part of our standard model and are included to demonstrate structure. I do, however, add theme-specific code as necessary. ***[Sample](https://github.com/sixty7ss/code-samples/tree/master/Style%20Structure)***
